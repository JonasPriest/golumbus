## What is golumbus?

It's a small command line utility to bookmark locations on your machines.
You can add (and overwrite), list and remove bookmark locations and of course jump to their paths.
So, make Golumbus your smart navigator that sails between projects quickly!

## How to use?

**Add a location:** `go add 'location name'`
You will be prompted for a description of this location.

**List your locations:** `go list`
All your locations will be listed, one per row.

**Remove a location:** `go rm 'location name'`
The location will be removed.

**Jump to a location:** `go to 'location name'`
Golumbus will navigate you to the bookmarked task.

Leave your scurvy at home, sailor.
